## Project Structure

### Controller

- **Responsibility**: Handles HTTP requests, interacts with services, and manages the flow of data to and from the client.
- **Advantages**: Separation of concerns, facilitates testing, and maintains a clean and clear API endpoint structure.

### Entities

- **Responsibility**: Represents the data model of your application. Entities are typically mapped to database tables.
- **Advantages**: Encapsulates data, provides a clear structure for the database schema, and allows for easy conversion between Java objects and database records.

### Services

- **Responsibility**: Business logic and application-specific functionality reside here. Services interact with entities and repositories.
- **Advantages**: Encapsulation of business logic, promotes reusability, and keeps controllers lightweight.

### Repositories

- **Responsibility**: Handles database operations. Repositories interact with the database and provide an abstraction layer over the underlying data store.
- **Advantages**: Separates data access logic from business logic, enables easy switching of data sources, and promotes code cleanliness.

## First Steps: Spring Boot, Maven, and MySQL

1. **Setup Spring Boot Project**: Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer .

2. **Configure MySQL**: Update `application.properties` in the `src/main/resources` folder with your MySQL database configuration:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
